Priority order

1. CSRD Export for Customer A (weeks 1-4)
2. Targeted refactor in parallel (weeks 2-4)
3. API for Customer B (weeks 5-8)


Why this order

Customer A is 80% of our ARR. Losing them could kill the company. Their request is well scoped and we have a clear March deadline.

Customer B's 150k is promising but its not signed yet. A serious partner can wait a few weeks. If they cant, they probably werent going to stick around anyway.

Engineering wants a full 3 week refactor but we cant freeze feature work for that long. Instead we clean up the specific modules were about to build on. Not perfect but practical.


Handling pushback

CS will ask "can we guarantee March?"
Yes. Customer A is number one. Share weekly progress, get on a call with them early to scope exact requirements.

Sales will say "we'll lose Customer B"
Tell them we start API in week 5, deliver by week 8. Help them craft the message for B. If a 4 week delay kills the deal they werent a reliable partner anyway.

Engineering will say "we need the full refactor first"
Agree on the problem, disagree on timing. We refactor the modules that export and API actually touch. Full debt sprint comes right after API ships.


Comms

Frame as sequencing not rejection. Were doing all three, just in the order that protects us best.

Meet eng lead 1:1 before the group meeting so they co-own the refactor plan.
Give sales a concrete timeline + talking points for customer B.
Weekly updates to CS so they can keep customer A in the loop.


If customer A faces a delay

Flag early. No suprises.
Show a working preview so they see progress.
Offer interim manual export if deadline gets tight.
Confident and transparent, not apologetic.
